    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pancakes are are cooked the old-fashioned way, the way a Grandma makes them, and there is no better food
        than the one Grandma makes!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>13 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk,
            melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using
            approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes.
            Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
